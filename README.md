## Summary

Idea is to take 3D objects and create relationships between the objects in 3D space using AI. Final results of generated new object can be a game character, a car, a mech, or a plane for example. First sub 3D objects are gategorized (this could also be done with machine learning) and each object have a certain interface in each gategory. Secondly code would try to produce desired assemblies out of these gategorized objects. Idea is to do this in Blender for this experiment.

At the moment time to work on this experiment is limited, so the example code may follow later once more time to work on this. Feel free to use the idea and build it, if interested. The usage concept is explained below.

Concept briefly is following. First sub 3D objects are gategorized (this could also be done with machine learning, but for this experiment this is not first priority) and each object have a certain interface in each gategory. Secondly code would try to produce desired assemblies out of these gategorized objects.

Usage:

Setting up the generator model for certain type of 3D models. (Later idea would be to figure out how to customize this for specific need)
